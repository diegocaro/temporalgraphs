# Compact data structures for Temporal Graphs

This repository contains the code for evaluating a sequence-based and 
a multidimensional approach for representing temporal graphs.

## Definition of Temporal Graphs 

Temporal graphs (also known as time-varying graphs) are graphs whose
vertex connectivity changes along time.


## Dependencies

- A compiler that supports C++11
- [Compact Data Structures Library][libcds] - low-level succinct data structures
- [Succinct Data Structure Library][sdsl-lite] - low-level succinct data structures 


## Author
Original concept and prototype by [Diego Caro][diegocaro].
